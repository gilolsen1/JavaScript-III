    <p>It was very useful to copy the Training kit example, follow it step by step, and write my notes IN the code as comments. <br>
    The Seinfield example is from the Training kit, my cookie monster example was crafted after understanding how it works. <br>
  Please don't tell my daughter I ate 10X the amount of cookies as she did, she'll be PISSED. </p>
