  <li>binding</li>
  <li>Why use semi colons instead of colons in Constructor function templates?</li>
  <li>WTF is ATTRS? and why it's used</li>
  <li>How to use this.attr1 = attr1; this.attr2= attr2</li>
  <li>Breaking out methods into an object's prototype = ObjectName.prototype.methodName=function() {//code} </li>
  <li>using .call as the first line in a constuctor function to inherit key:value pairs from parent</li>
  <li>using object.create() to inherit prototypes</li>

<h2>ACUTELY AWARE --></h2>
<div>
    <p>It was very useful to copy the Training kit example, follow it step by step, and write my notes IN the code as comments. <br>
    The Seinfield example is from the Training kit, my cookie monster example was crafted after understanding how it works. <br>
  Please don't tell my daughter I ate 10X the amount of cookies as she did, she'll be PISSED. </p>

<p> <h2>USING NEW AND CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION: MAPPING FROM OBJECT LITERAL THAT IS FED TO ConstructorFunction ()</h2> </p>
<p>Following image is my drawings over the Lambda TK section on constructor functions. <br>
this is when I understood creating a new Function, passing in and object of attributes getting mapped into the tempate.</p>

<p><h2>Constuctor Function notes:</h2>
<h3 >attrs, this.attrs1=attrs1; , why semicolons? and color:purple; breaking out method into prototype</h3>
<p>set up styled template for these notes sheets!!!</p>

<p>My Original Version: understood constructor function from TK</p>
<p>pair programming with standup Ryan and ernesto, didn't really understand it super well</p>
<p>followup with PM / Randy to break down and compare both, answering my questions in comments</p>
<p>broke down how to attack the next problem, then set to struggle on it. </p>
<p>created this image / reviewed by making this page</p>

<h2>INHERITANCE PLAN OF ATTACK</h2>

<hr>
<h1>EXECUTION</h1>
<p>Was able to follow that plan of attack and get 90% of the way there. <br>
  the last 10% was the hardest. <br>

  <h3>object.create has to be OUTSIDE the constructor function. I was writing it INSIDE.</h3>
  <p>(right below.call, above this.healthpoints/first keytemplate)</p> <br>
  By moving those 3 lines of code outside the function, the entire thing worked. 
</p>
<hr>
<h1>Step 1- .Call() in first line of constructor function</h1>

<img src="./images/call_link_keyvaluetemplate.png" alt="call function">
<p>On line 66, I call GameObjects (the parent object) and use .call. 
  I pass in "This" (the new Character Stats object this function is creating) and the attrs object. <br>
This step includes all the "this.key=attrs.values" from the parent object in each new CharacterStats object </p>
<p>THE PROTOTYPE INHERITANCE IS A SEPERATE STEP, OUTSIDE THE CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION</p>
<hr>
<h1>PROTOTYPE INHERITANCE via OBJECT.CREATE</h1>
<p>KINDLY NOTE: Constructor function ends at 69 } and this starts at 71 : ) </p>
<img src="./images/prototype inheritance.png" alt="proto inheritance">
<p>line 71 is the only active code <br>
in english: " hey javscript... I'm talking about CharacterStats object, specifically, the prototype of that object. <br>
Make it the same as whatever is passed in from the create method... in this case, the GameObject's prototype <br>
THIS IS WHERE I'M MAKING THE PROTOTYPES THE SAME</p>
