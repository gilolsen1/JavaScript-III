<h2>ACUTELY AWARE --></h2>
<div>
    <p>It was very useful to copy the Training kit example, follow it step by step, and write my notes IN the code as comments. <br>
    The Seinfield example is from the Training kit, my cookie monster example was crafted after understanding how it works. <br>
  Please don't tell my daughter I ate 10X the amount of cookies as she did, she'll be PISSED. </p>

<h3 >attrs, this.attrs1=attrs1; , why semicolons? and color:purple; breaking out method into prototype</h3>
<p>set up styled template for these notes sheets!!!</p>

<p>My Original Version: understood constructor function from TK</p>
<p>pair programming with standup Ryan and ernesto, didn't really understand it super well</p>
<p>followup with PM / Randy to break down and compare both, answering my questions in comments</p>
<p>broke down how to attack the next problem, then set to struggle on it. </p>
